# To-Do List App 🗒️

This is a simple to-do list app built with Python and Tkinter. It’s a basic desktop application that helps you manage daily tasks with ease.

You can add new tasks, delete the ones you’ve completed, edit existing ones, or even clear the whole list if you’re starting fresh. There’s also a feature to select a task so you can quickly load it back into the entry box for editing.

It’s beginner-friendly, doesn’t need any external libraries, and is a fun little project if you're learning Python or just want a personal task manager.
